# Digital Storytelling and Social Media

Northeastern University, School of Journalism
Fall 2017

## Overview

This course will expose you to a suite of tools and methods employed in contemporary reporting, editing, design and delivery. It will also introduce you to the collaborative design process, with which we will ideate, prototype, test and iterate your projects. While this course will introduce you to the emerging applications, technology and ideas of digital storytelling and design thinking, its bedrock is journalism: accurate reporting and ethical storytelling in the public interest, which you will be expected to demonstrate in every assignment. 

We will touch on many areas – community engagement, digital publishing analytics, new media business models – but devote the most time to exploring the tools and methods of **data visualization**, **social media publishing** and **digital storytelling **using the **collaborative design process**. We will put those concepts and tools into practice first through individual assignments and later through large projects completed in groups.
